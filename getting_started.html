	<h1>The Meeting and Courtship</h1>
<p>First my first HTML project I thought that it would be fine it I took the idea of a tribute site and put it as how Sarah and I met.</p>

<p>Well if you want to understand how we meet you need to go way back to like last December.  She and her roommates had just moved into the ward in August and the ward was finally starting to get to know each other.  You see with Covid and everything we were all confined to our own homes.  Well I had meet this girl first in church.  Then there is this dating app called Mutual that I was using at the time and I actually matched with her on Mutual. </p>

<p>Well we started messaging a little bit and I was kind of sick of Mutual and wanted to meet up in person, and actually do something, well this was in front of me and I figure why not just ask her if she wanted to get together.  Well I did and she said well don't you wantt o get to know me first before you decide to commit to a date.  At that point I repsonded what do you mean, like at church or something.  She did not respond after that</p>

<p>This is a test </p>
